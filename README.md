***Plant Disease Detection with Transfer Learning***

****

This project implements a machine learning model for classifying plant diseases using image recognition. The model is based on transfer learning with a pre-trained VGG19 model.

>Dependencies: 

This project requires the following Python libraries:


* numpy

* cv2

* os

* pandas

* seaborn

* matplotlib

* tensorflow

* keras

>Data: 

The dataset used for training and testing the model is from the Plant Village dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease). It contains images of various plant diseases.





>Performance Improvement:

The included code demonstrates how Batch Normalization is added after flattening the pre-trained features as a performance improvement technique. You can explore other techniques like:

* Data Augmentation: 

	Artificially increasing the size and diversity of your training data by applying random transformations like rotations, flips, and scaling.

* Hyperparameter Tuning:

	Experimenting with different learning rates, batch sizes, and optimizer configurations to achieve optimal performance.

* Fine-tuning: 

	Allowing a few of the top layers of the pre-trained model to be trainable during the training process.

>Results

	The current model achieves an accuracy of approximately 82% on the test dataset.
